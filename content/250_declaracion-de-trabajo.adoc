The declaraci√≥n de trabajo (SOW) for this engagement should be provided inline in
the engagement report for reference and review.  The SOW represents the
agreement made between Red Hat and the customer and can be essential for
tracking progress and managing scope changes.

The SOW can be inserted as an image or as a textual copy of the original
statement of work.  Either way the task list and any amendments need to be
clearly legible.
