In the "Base" directory, this section is a placeholder which is to be
overwritten by architecture specific to the product or products being
delivered.

If "TODO" appears in your document after the init script has been run, then your product directory is missing a corresponding "architecture.adoc" which should be implemented to provide a basic architecture framework for that product.
